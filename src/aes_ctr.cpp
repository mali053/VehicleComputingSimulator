/**
 Encrypts a single block of data using AES in CTR mode.
 This function handles the encryption of a single block in CTR (Counter) mode.
 It computes the counter value based on the given initialization vector (IV) and
 block index, encrypts the counter, and then XORs the encrypted counter with the
 input block to produce the output block.
 @param input     Pointer to the input block of plaintext data (BLOCK_BYTES_LEN bytes).
 @param output    Pointer to the output block where the encrypted ciphertext will be stored (BLOCK_BYTES_LEN bytes).
 @param roundKeys Pointer to the array of round keys used for AES encryption.
 @param keyLength The length of the AES key being used (e.g., AES_KEY_LENGTH_128, AES_KEY_LENGTH_192, AES_KEY_LENGTH_256).
 @param iv        Pointer to the initialization vector (IV) used for the counter.
 @param blockIndex The index of the current block to be encrypted, used to compute the counter value.
